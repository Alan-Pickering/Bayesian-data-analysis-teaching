%To use AP's Bayesian modelling code:-
%1) Copy these files to a folder. And run any script from within that folder
%   in the usual way. The powerpoint talks in this repository give you a context
%   for the use of the scripts, but what they do is described below
%
%MLE_to_BF.m       (see talk 2) 
%bayes_table.m     (see talk 3, forthcoming)
%constantX_check.m (see talk 3, forthcoming)
%
%More scripts will be added here later
%
%What do these scripts do?
%*************************
%1) Run MLE_to_BF.m to convert (log)likelihoods, obtained under MLE model estimation
%   for two models, into Bayes factors comparing the two models.
%2) Run bayes_table.m to explore the classic billiard table problem in Bayesian estimation
%3) Run constantX_check.m to check Bayes' 1764 claim about integrating
%   binomials
%
%) For more info on a specific script please type  one of the following
%   
%   help MLE_to_BF
%   help bayes_table 
%   help constanX_check
