%To use AP's Bayesian modelling code:-
%1) Copy these files to a folder. And run them from within that folder.
%
%bayes_table.m
%MLE_to_BF.m
%
%More scripts will be added here later
%
%2) Run bayes_table.m to explore a classic problem in Bayesian estimation
%3) Run MLE_to_BF.m to convert (log)likelihoods, obtained under MLE model estimation
%   for two models, into Bayes factors comparing the two models.
%
